This is the code to recreate the CMV primary infection analysis. The code used is currently in my dropbox and a private github repo but contains a ton of exploratory analysis and extrananeous analysis not included in the manuscript.

TO DO:
1. Add a folder and figure to describe the 6 excluded infants

2. Consolidate the episode analysis code - can probably use most of old files, just remove unnecessary packages, make sure PatientID2 is used, have explicit output for each figure and table. Should there be an .Rmd for EDA that wasn't included (correlation analysis, serum analysis)?

3. Consolidate the mathematical model code - base (exponential portion) model, target-cell model, CTL model, virus-mediated model. Should be able to transfer old figures and files, just need to change PatientID codes.

4. Batch code and scripts, what batch data is needed?

5. Add READMEs for each section and make a data dictionary.
