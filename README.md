This is the code to recreate the CMV primary infection analysis. The code used is currently in my dropbox and a private github repo but contains a ton of exploratory analysis and extrananeous analysis not included in the manuscript.

TO DO:
1. Consolidate the mathematical model code - base (exponential portion) model, target-cell model, CTL model, virus-mediated model. Should be able to transfer old figures and files, just need to change PatientID codes.

2. Batch code and scripts, what batch data is needed?

3. Add READMEs for model sections

4. Add final update for this README when completed
