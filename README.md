# CMV-Primary-Analysis

This repository contains a reproduction of the analysis code for "Dynamics of persistent oral cytomegalovirus shedding during primary infection in Ugandan infants." The article has been published in the Journal of Infectious Diseases:
http://jid.oxfordjournals.org/content/214/11/1735

[A copy of the Supplement is also located here.](https://github.com/bryanmayer/CMV-Primary-Infection/blob/master/Supplementary-Materials.pdf)

The main components of the analysis are:    
#[1) All of the data used in the analysis](https://github.com/bryanmayer/CMV-Primary-Infection/tree/master/data)    
#[2) General Episode Analysis](https://github.com/bryanmayer/CMV-Primary-Infection/tree/master/data-analysis)    
#[3) Mathematical Model Analysis](https://github.com/bryanmayer/CMV-Primary-Infection/tree/master/mathematical-models)    


Figures and tables included in the manuscript were generated from this code. Model fitting was done using a cluster server. The code used for that analysis is in this repo but only for reference.  R version and package version information (including the info from the server) is available in the [R-version-info directory](https://github.com/bryanmayer/CMV-Primary-Infection/tree/master/R-version-info).
