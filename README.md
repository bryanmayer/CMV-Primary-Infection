# CMV-Primary-Analysis

This contains a reproduction of the analysis code for "Dynamics of persistent oral cytomegalovirus shedding during primary infection in Ugandan infants." The manuscript is available here:


Here are the main components:
#[1) All of the data used in the analysis](https://github.fhcrc.org/bmayer/CMV-Primary-Infection/tree/master/data)
#[2) General Episode Analysis](https://github.fhcrc.org/bmayer/CMV-Primary-Infection/tree/master/data-analysis)
#[3) Mathematical Model Analysis](https://github.fhcrc.org/bmayer/CMV-Primary-Infection/tree/master/mathematical-models)


Figures and tables included in the manuscript were generated from this code. Model fitting was done using a cluster server. The code used for that analysis is in this repo but only for reference.  R version information (including the info from the server) is contained at the top level of this directory.
